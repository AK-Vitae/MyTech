# Overview

MyTech is a super simple inventory solution that helps people easily track what they have, when they got it, and any other relevant information.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project stemmed from both situational and personal interests. While quarantining at home, I started to pile up a lot of tech purchases and even made the mistake of buying the same thing twice. To prevent that issue from happening again and to expand my knowledge of Swift/SwiftUI, I set out to design/develop this application.

## Features

- A simple way to catalog tech-related items and their relevant information (name, type of technology, serial number, model number, product number, and date acquired)
- Functionality for adding pictures about tech item from either the camera or photo library
- Data persistence with integration with Core Data
- Export data in .csv format
- Support for both Light and Dark mode.

## Installation Instructions

For now, MyTech can only be downloaded on iOS devices from the App Store.
